Molten aluminium produced from the electrolytic process is tapped from reduction cells, weighed, sampled and analysed before it is poured into a holding furnace and heated to approximately 750°C using natural gas as a fuel. Alloying elements, such as magnesium, silicon and manganese, for additional strength, corrosion resistance and other properties, are added to the aluminium. It is typically at this point in the process that clean, sorted scrap can also be added but for the purposes of this dataset, scrap remelting is excluded. During furnace charging and preparation, aluminium dross (a thick liquid or solid phase) forms at the surface of molten aluminium. This mixture of aluminium oxides is remelted to recover the aluminium that would otherwise be lost. Metallurgical analysis verifies that the metal meets customer specifications before the molten, alloyed (or pure, unalloyed) aluminium is cast into products of specific dimensions, before being weighed, bundled and strapped ready for transport. Original dataset included some alloying elements.  These were replaced by liquid aluminium to generate a theoretical 100% aluminium ingot.

Primary aluminium is produced by the The Hall-Héroult process, developed in 1886, and the sole industrial method for the smelting of primary aluminium. It involves passing a large electric current through a molten mixture of cryolite, alumina and aluminium fluoride to obtain pure, liquid aluminium metal. Direct current (DC) is fed into a line of electrolytic cells connected in series (a “potline”). While these cells, or “pots” and potlines vary in size and configuration from one plant to another, the fundamental electrochemical process is identical. Each pot is a large carbon-lined metal container, forming the negative electrode (cathode) in the cell. The cell contains an electrolytic bath of molten cryolite (Na3AlF6), maintained at a temperature of around 960 – 980°C, in which alumina powder (Al2O3) is dissolved. Aluminium fluoride (AlF3) is added to the solution to maintain optimal chemistry and lower the electrolyte’s freezing point. Large carbon blocks are suspended in the solution and serve as the positive electrode (anode). The electrical current passes from the carbon anodes via the bath to the carbon cathode cell lining. The current then passes to the anode of the next pot in series. As the electrical current passes through the solution, the dissolved alumina is split into molten aluminium (Al) and oxygen (O2). The oxygen consumes the carbon in the anode blocks to form carbon dioxide. The electrolytic reaction can be expressed as:

2Al2O3 + 3C → 4Al + 3CO2

The current then passes to the anode of the next pot in series. As the electrical current passes through the solution, the dissolved alumina is split into molten aluminium (Al) and oxygen (O2). The oxygen consumes the carbon in the anode blocks to form carbon dioxide. The electrolytic reaction can be expressed as:

2Al2O3 + 3C → 4Al + 3CO2

There are two main types of aluminium smelting technology: Søderberg and prebake. The principal difference between the two is the type of anode used.

Hydraulic fracturing can be conducted by injecting only pure water at high pressure into the rock, as often done for Enhanced Geothermal Systems (Grosser Rat BS 2003, McClure 2012). A big variety of chemicals is often added in deep shale natural gas and oil fracturing in a 0.5-2 vol% range (US Department of Energy 2009, Chesapeake Energy 2012). The US Committee on Energy (2011) indicates the use of over 700 different chemicals, out of them the most recent: Methanol, Isopropanol, Silica-quartz, 2-Butoxyethanol, Ethylene glycol, hydrotreated light petrolium distillates, sodium hydroxide. According to the US Committee for Energy (2011), the composition of these fluids varies by formation, ranging from a simple mixture of water and sand to more complex mixtures with a multitude of chemical additives. The companies may use these chemical additives to thicken or thin the fluids, improve the flow of the fluid, or kill bacteria that can reduce fracturing performance. According to (US Department of Energy 2009), a typical fracture treatment will use very low choncentrations of between 3 and 12 additive chemicals depending on the characteristics of the water and the shale formation being fractures. Overall the concentration of additives in most fracturing fluids is a relatively consisten 0.5% to 2% with water making up 98% to 99.5%. This dataset is modeled with 0.5vol% additives which cover the range of all possible functions that could be built into a fracturing fluid.

The liquefaction process of air represents an average cryogenic air separation process. Cryogenic air separation is currently the most efficient and cost-effective technology for producing large quantities of oxygen, nitrogen, and argon as gaseous or liquid products (Smith & Klosek 2001). The fraction of each output is based on the composition of air (1.4% Argon, 23.1% Oxygen and 75.5% Nitrogen).;Nitrogen (N2) constitutes 78.09% by volume of the air. It is colourless, odourless, and tasteless. Nitrogen is often used as an 'inert' gas due to its non-reactive nature with many materials. Commercial nitrogen is produced by different air separation processes, such as cryogenic liquefaction and distillation, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) and membrane separation. Liquid nitrogen, produced by the cryogenic air separation process, finds wide use as a refrigerant in applications such as cryogenic grinding of plastics and food freezing. Gaseous nitrogen is used in the chemical and petroleum industries for storage tank blanketing and vessel inerting applications, in the food industries to pack oxidisable foods and by the electronics and metals industries for the inert properties.;Oxygen (O2) constitutes 20.95% by volume of the air. Liquid oxygen is pale blue. The principal use of oxygen stems from its strong oxidising properties. Oxygen is produced by air separation processes that use either cryogenic liquefaction and distillation or separation with vacuum swing adsorption (VSA). The major commercial uses of oxygen are in metal manufacturing, metal fabricating, and in health services. Oxygen is also used extensively in the chemical industry and in the pulp and paper industry.;Argon (Ar) is a monatomic, chemically inert gas composing slightly less than 0.93% by volume of the air. Argon is colourless, odourless, tasteless, non-corrosive, non-flammable, and non-toxic. Argon is the most abundant and most used of the noble gases. Commercial argon is the product of cryogenic air separation. Argon is the most abundant and most used of the noble gases. Its chief use is in metallurgy, where it provides an inert atmosphere in which hot metals can be worked.

Another very important area where sodium chloride is used is the human and animal nutrition, since all animals, humans included, need both sodium and chloride. Other relevant areas of use of salt are the maintenance and de-icing of roads as well as the conditioning of water. ;In Europe, the possibilities for producing salt by solar evaporation are rather poor and concentrated around the Mediterranean area. Therefore, this dataset represents the production of dry sodium chloride by underground mining (51%) and by solution mining (49%). This dataset is based on data from a European salt producer, as well as literature.;References:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.

In general a duplex process is used applying a zinc and paint coating to further improve the corrosion protection. In addition, the selection of the colour can improve the embedding into the landscape <van Oeteren 1988>. With this additional protection the zinc emissions into soil can be neglected <van Oeteren 1988>.
 - leakage of insulation oil from cables and electro technical equipment (transformers, switchgear, circuit breakers) because this only happens in case of accidental release

Since refineries are very complex the actual unit process modeling is done in a separate refinery model by ifeu and this is a subdivided product-specific dataset.;The ifeu refinery model reproduces the complexity of petroleum refinery plants in which the combination and sequence of processes are usually very specific to the characteristics of the raw materials (i.e. the close relation between the composition of the crude oil and the products to be produced). Refineries differ not only in their configurations, process integration, feedstocks, product mixes, unit sizes, designs, and control systems but also the market situations, locations and ages of the refinery or environmental regulations can result in a wide variety of refinery concepts. It represents the current European state-of-the-art. The basic setting of the model reflects the technical characteristics of European refineries as described in the BREF - BAT reference document for the Refining of Mineral Oil and Gas. Further specific data was collected from companies and production plants and was incorporated in order to elaborate a comprehensive and robust model of a refinery.;The BREF contains not only aggregated numbers or weighted averages of emission and energy or water consumptions, but also encompasses primary data of the majority of refineries in Europe in anonymous form. The data quality is excellent. This data source has been complemented by various specific confidential refinery datasets, by values from Eurostat (e.g. in the case of the energy source mix or process energy), and by literature data. In the case of the BREF, a range of values were mentioned as process parameters for which the arithmetic averages were applied. After adapting the model to the up-to-date mass and energy flows within the European refineries, it has been validated and calibrated by comparing the results to the dataset of the BREF, the Eurostat and the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR).;Despite the default settings (weighted EU average), the refinery model was adjusted to fit typical refinery production data in the special geographies. In order to do this data from the refineries in the countries was analysed and an assessment of the refinery complexity (according to the BREF classes) was done. Furthermore crude oil qualities were researched an adjusted (e.g. sulphur content and API class) to fit the specified geography.;Documentation for this model can be found in the ecoinvent refinery report by Fehrenbach et al. (2018). Activity starts with crude oil entering the petroleum refinery.  Waste water treatment, fresh water supply (from nature), refinery infrastructure, crude oil and product storage on refinery grounds and energy provision is included. From cradle, i.e. including all upstream activities. Activity ends with refinery products leaving the petroleum refinery. Mineral oil refineries are highly integrated multi-output production plants where nearly each process step creates a few co-products. ;Unlike many other refinery models, which tend to consider a refinery as a black-box, here a step by step calculation of the complex network of refinery processes was done and gives an integrated sum of all connected processes. The allocation is executed within each of these steps allowing the implementation of the allocation rules at process step level separately and globally, over the system of all steps.;The allocation approach implemented within the ifeu refinery model is designed to consider the complexity of the production system, the valuation of the products (upgrading/downgrading of feedstock material during a specific process), real physical mass flows. The combined allocation procedure is stated by the following sequence of four rules:;1. the general allocation rule refers to the energy content (Rationale: the majority of refinery products are used for energy purposes.);2. The expenditures for the first step of separation (atmospheric distillation) are allocated to all co-products, including the atmospheric residue (Rationale: all co-products from atmospheric distillation will end up in marketable final products.);3. The expenditures for any subsequent process step intended to reduce the quantity of non-intended products (i.e. vacuum distillation and cracking) are allocated to all co-products except for the non-intended products (residues). (Rationale: all these downstream processes within the refinery are intended to reduce non-intended products in favour to increase the yield of non-residual co-products; hence, the expenditures are only allocated to the yielded products.);4. Retention of feedstock: The 3rd rule refers to the allocation of the respective process expenditures; it does not include the allocation of feedstocks. The input material (feedstock) into a refinery process step is always allocated according to the 1st rule: e.g. visbreaker residue takes 40 % energy content of the totalized co-product output of a visbreaker cracker output therefore 40 % of the visbreaker input (vacuum distillate) and its upstream burden is allocated to the visbreaker residue . (Rationale: Although the downstream processing steps are not intended to produce residues only to reduce them, the residual final products derived from residues (e.g. heavy fuel oil, petroleum coke) are defined as refinery products and not as wastes; if the 3rd rule would apply also for the allocation of feedstock, all final products from non-intended products (residues) would finally achieve LCIs with zero expenditures and emission; de facto they would be treated the same way as waste.) ;The combined allocation procedure involves following consequences:;• The LCI of every refinery product encloses at least 1 MJ crude oil per MJ product feedstock; considering that some refinery products have lower LHVs than crude oil (e.g. petroleum coke or heavy fuel oil), such refinery products enclose less than 1 kg crude oil per kg product;;• Final products with relevant shares derived from sequential processing accumulate higher loads than products predominantly derived from straight-run;;• An exception is the heavy products derived from non-intended products, even if they pass a cascade of cracking processes; without rule 3 and 4 heavy fuel oil would turn out to be the product with the highest burden, which would contradict any value-based perception of the refining business.

Since refineries are very complex the actual unit process modeling is done in a separate refinery model by ifeu and this is a subdivided product-specific dataset.;The ifeu refinery model reproduces the complexity of petroleum refinery plants in which the combination and sequence of processes are usually very specific to the characteristics of the raw materials (i.e. the close relation between the composition of the crude oil and the products to be produced). Refineries differ not only in their configurations, process integration, feedstocks, product mixes, unit sizes, designs, and control systems but also the market situations, locations and ages of the refinery or environmental regulations can result in a wide variety of refinery concepts. It represents the current European state-of-the-art. The basic setting of the model reflects the technical characteristics of European refineries as described in the BREF - BAT reference document for the Refining of Mineral Oil and Gas. Further specific data was collected from companies and production plants and was incorporated in order to elaborate a comprehensive and robust model of a refinery.;The BREF contains not only aggregated numbers or weighted averages of emission and energy or water consumptions, but also encompasses primary data of the majority of refineries in Europe in anonymous form. The data quality is excellent. This data source has been complemented by various specific confidential refinery datasets, by values from Eurostat (e.g. in the case of the energy source mix or process energy), and by literature data. In the case of the BREF, a range of values were mentioned as process parameters for which the arithmetic averages were applied. After adapting the model to the up-to-date mass and energy flows within the European refineries, it has been validated and calibrated by comparing the results to the dataset of the BREF, the Eurostat and the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR).;Despite the default settings (weighted EU average), the refinery model was adjusted to fit typical refinery production data in the special geographies. In order to do this data from the refineries in the countries was analysed and an assessment of the refinery complexity (according to the BREF classes) was done. Furthermore crude oil qualities were researched an adjusted (e.g. sulphur content and API class) to fit the specified geography.;Documentation for this model can be found in the ecoinvent refinery report by Fehrenbach et al. (2018). Activity starts with crude oil entering the petroleum refinery.  Waste water treatment, fresh water supply (from nature), refinery infrastructure, crude oil and product storage on refinery grounds and energy provision is included. From cradle, i.e. including all upstream activities. Activity ends with refinery products leaving the petroleum refinery. Mineral oil refineries are highly integrated multi-output production plants where nearly each process step creates a few co-products. ;Unlike many other refinery models, which tend to consider a refinery as a black-box, here a step by step calculation of the complex network of refinery processes was done and gives an integrated sum of all connected processes. The allocation is executed within each of these steps allowing the implementation of the allocation rules at process step level separately and globally, over the system of all steps.;The allocation approach implemented within the ifeu refinery model is designed to consider the complexity of the production system, the valuation of the products (upgrading/downgrading of feedstock material during a specific process), real physical mass flows. The combined allocation procedure is stated by the following sequence of four rules:;1. the general allocation rule refers to the energy content (Rationale: the majority of refinery products are used for energy purposes.);2. The expenditures for the first step of separation (atmospheric distillation) are allocated to all co-products, including the atmospheric residue (Rationale: all co-products from atmospheric distillation will end up in marketable final products.);3. The expenditures for any subsequent process step intended to reduce the quantity of non-intended products (i.e. vacuum distillation and cracking) are allocated to all co-products except for the non-intended products (residues). (Rationale: all these downstream processes within the refinery are intended to reduce non-intended products in favour to increase the yield of non-residual co-products; hence, the expenditures are only allocated to the yielded products.);4. Retention of feedstock: The 3rd rule refers to the allocation of the respective process expenditures; it does not include the allocation of feedstocks. The input material (feedstock) into a refinery process step is always allocated according to the 1st rule: e.g. visbreaker residue takes 40 % energy content of the totalized co-product output of a visbreaker cracker output therefore 40 % of the visbreaker input (vacuum distillate) and its upstream burden is allocated to the visbreaker residue . (Rationale: Although the downstream processing steps are not intended to produce residues only to reduce them, the residual final products derived from residues (e.g. heavy fuel oil, petroleum coke) are defined as refinery products and not as wastes; if the 3rd rule would apply also for the allocation of feedstock, all final products from non-intended products (residues) would finally achieve LCIs with zero expenditures and emission; de facto they would be treated the same way as waste.) ;The combined allocation procedure involves following consequences:;• The LCI of every refinery product encloses at least 1 MJ crude oil per MJ product feedstock; considering that some refinery products have lower LHVs than crude oil (e.g. petroleum coke or heavy fuel oil), such refinery products enclose less than 1 kg crude oil per kg product;;• Final products with relevant shares derived from sequential processing accumulate higher loads than products predominantly derived from straight-run;;• An exception is the heavy products derived from non-intended products, even if they pass a cascade of cracking processes; without rule 3 and 4 heavy fuel oil would turn out to be the product with the highest burden, which would contradict any value-based perception of the refining business.

According to expert judgement, a production volume-weighted average including the regional activities available in ecoinvent v3.6 (BR, CH, CO, Europe without Switzerland, IN, PE, ZA) would overestimate the share of refinery complexity type IV in the global petroleum refinery sector. The mix of refinery complexity types used for the European activity was, therefore, found to be a more appropriate proxy for this GLO dataset. This limitation in representativeness of the GLO dataset should be kept in mind when using it.;The describes the operation of a petroleum oil refinery of representative configuration and quality of crude oil input for European conditions. Since petroleum refineries are very complex the actual unit process modeling is done in a separate refinery tool, developed by ifeu (Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, Heidelberg, Germany) and this is a subdivided product-specific dataset.;The ifeu petroleum refinery life cycle inventory (LCI) tool is based on the outputs of a complex refinery model that reproduces the complexity of petroleum refinery plants in which the combination and sequence of processes are usually very specific to the characteristics of the raw materials (i.e. the close relation between the composition of the crude oil and the products to be produced). Refineries differ not only in their configurations, process integration, feedstocks, product mixes, unit sizes, designs, and control systems but also the market situations, locations and ages of the refinery or environmental regulations can result in a wide variety of refinery concepts. It represents the current European state-of-the-art. The basic setting of the model reflects the technical characteristics of European refineries as described in the Best Available Techniques (BAT) Reference Document (BREF) for the Refining of Mineral Oil and Gas (European Commission, 2015). Further specific data was collected from companies and production plants and was incorporated in order to elaborate a comprehensive and robust model of a refinery.;The BREF (European Commission, 2015) contains not only aggregated numbers or weighted averages of emission and energy or water consumptions, but also encompasses primary data of the majority of refineries in Europe in anonymous form. This data source has been complemented by various specific confidential refinery datasets, by values from Eurostat (e.g. in the case of the energy source mix or process energy), and by literature data. In the case of the BREF, a range of values were mentioned as process parameters for which the arithmetic averages were applied. After adapting the model to the up-to-date mass and energy flows within the European refineries, it has been validated and calibrated by comparing the results to the dataset of the BREF, the Eurostat and the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR).;The simplified LCI tool can be adjusted to average conditions of a specific geography through the following parameters: refinery complexity (according to the complexity classes defined in the BREF document, type I-IV), crude oil sulfur content and American Petroleum Institute (API) gravity classification. To create this dataset, the above parameters were set to represent the average situation in Europe without Switzerland: ;Crude quality – API and sulfur content: Crude imports to Europe by country of origin were taken from BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2017 (Oil: Inter-area movements 2016) (BP, 2017) and matched with the crude quality reported for these regions in ENI World Oil Review 2018 (ENI, 2018). The resulting weighted average API grade of crude imports to Europe is 35, and the weighted average sulfur content 1.03%. ;Refinery complexity: The 2018 World Refining Survey (OGJ, 2018) reports the configuration of 107 refineries in Europe. According to their configuration each refinery was assigned a refinery type (I-IV) as defined in the BREF document. Weighted by the annual throughput volume, 62% of European refineries classify as type II, 29% as type II and 9% as type IV.;LCIs were generated for BREF type II, III and IV for API 35 and sulfur content 1.03% (applying linear interpolation between sulfur content of 1% and 3%). This dataset was created as weighted average of types II-IV according to the above shares. Activity starts with crude oil entering the petroleum refinery. Waste water treatment, freshwater supply (from nature), refinery infrastructure, crude oil and product storage on refinery grounds and energy provision is included. Electricity requirements are assumed to be met by on-site generation, regardless whether this electricity is purchased or supplied internally. From cradle, i.e. including all upstream activities. Activity ends with refined petroleum products (and surplus electricity and/or hydrogen, where relevant) leaving the refinery. Petroleum oil refineries are highly integrated multi-output production plants where nearly each process step creates a few co-products. The procedure for subdividing and allocating the burden per refinery process step among the product outputs is described in detail in Fehrenbach et al. (2018).",ProcessType.LCI_RESULT,2021-01-05T00:55:39.194+08:00,03.03.003,Rest-of-World,1920:Manufacture of refined petroleum products

Since petroleum refineries are very complex the actual unit process modeling is done in a separate refinery tool, developed by ifeu (Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, Heidelberg, Germany) and this is a subdivided product-specific dataset.;The ifeu petroleum refinery life cycle inventory (LCI) tool is based on the outputs of a complex refinery model that reproduces the complexity of petroleum refinery plants in which the combination and sequence of processes are usually very specific to the characteristics of the raw materials (i.e. the close relation between the composition of the crude oil and the products to be produced). Refineries differ not only in their configurations, process integration, feedstocks, product mixes, unit sizes, designs, and control systems but also the market situations, locations and ages of the refinery or environmental regulations can result in a wide variety of refinery concepts. It represents the current European state-of-the-art. The basic setting of the model reflects the technical characteristics of European refineries as described in the Best Available Techniques (BAT) Reference Document (BREF)for the Refining of Mineral Oil and Gas (European Commission, 2015). Further specific data was collected from companies and production plants and was incorporated in order to elaborate a comprehensive and robust model of a refinery.;The BREF (European Commission, 2015) contains not only aggregated numbers or weighted averages of emission and energy or water consumptions, but also encompasses primary data of the majority of refineries in Europe in anonymous form. This data source has been complemented by various specific confidential refinery datasets, by values from Eurostat (e.g. in the case of the energy source mix or process energy), and by literature data. In the case of the BREF, a range of values were mentioned as process parameters for which the arithmetic averages were applied. After adapting the model to the up-to-date mass and energy flows within the European refineries, it has been validated and calibrated by comparing the results to the dataset of the BREF, the Eurostat and the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR).;The simplified LCI tool can be adjusted to average conditions of a specific geography through the following parameters: refinery complexity (according to the complexity classes defined in the BREF document, type I-IV), crude oil sulfur content and American Petroleum Institute (API) gravity classification. To create this dataset, the above parameters were set to represent the average situation in Europe without Switzerland: ;Crude quality – API and sulfur content: Crude imports to Europe by country of origin were taken from BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2017 (Oil: Inter-area movements 2016) (BP, 2017) and matched with the crude quality reported for these regions in ENI World Oil Review 2018 (ENI, 2018). The resulting weighted average API grade of crude imports to Europe is 35, and the weighted average sulfur content 1.03%. ;Refinery complexity: The 2018 World Refining Survey (OGJ, 2018) reports the configuration of 107 refineries in Europe. According to their configuration each refinery was assigned a refinery type (I-IV) as defined in the BREF document. Weighted by the annual throughput volume, 62% of European refineries classify as type II, 29% as type II and 9% as type IV.;LCIs were generated for BREF type II, III and IV for API 35 and sulfur content 1.03% (applying linear interpolation between sulfur content of 1% and 3%). This dataset was created as weighted average of types II-IV according to the above shares.;Supporting documentation for the model underlying the ifeu tool can be found in the ecoinvent report on the petroleum refinery industry for the SRI project, by Fehrenbach et al. (2018).;Reference(s): ;BP (2017) BP Statistical Review of World Energy June 2017, online at https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp-country/de_ch/PDF/bp-statistical-review-of-world-energy-2017-full-report.pdf, last accessed March 2019.;ENI (2018) World Oil Review 2018, Volume 1, online at https://www.eni.com/docs/it_IT/eni-com/azienda/fuel-cafe/WORLD-OIL-REVIEW-2018-Volume-1.pdf, last accessed March 2019.;European Commission (2015) Best Available Techniques (BAT) Reference Document (BREF) for the Refining of Mineral Oil and Gas, Industrial Emissions Directive 2010/75/EU Integrated Pollution Prevention and control, accessible online at http://eippcb.jrc.ec.europa.eu/reference/BREF/REF_BREF_2015.pdf, February 2019;Fehrenbach, H., Liebich, A., Abdalla, N., Biemann, K., Fröhlich, T.

Waste water treatment, freshwater supply (from nature), refinery infrastructure, crude oil and product storage on refinery grounds and energy provision is included. Electricity requirements are assumed to be met by the on-site generation mix (either supplied internally or purchased from co-located generation entities).
 From cradle, i.e. including all upstream activities. Activity ends with refined petroleum products (and surplus electricity and/or hydrogen, where relevant) leaving the refinery. Petroleum oil refineries are highly integrated multi-output production plants where nearly each process step creates a few co-products.

This dataset includes: 
  - electricity inputs produced in this country and from imports and transformed to medium voltage
 - the transmission network
 - direct emissions to air (SF6 from the insulation gas in the high voltage level switchgear are allocated to the electricity demand on medium voltage). 
 - electricity losses during transmission 

This dataset doesn't include
 - electricity losses during transformation from high to medium voltage or medium to low, as these are included in the dataset for transformation
  - leakage of insulation oil from cables and electro technical equipment (transformers, switchgear, circuit breakers) because this only happens in case of accidental release
 - SF6 emissions during production and deconstruction of the switchgear, as these are accounted for in the transmission network dataset.

Clinker is the main constituent of Portland cement and also the main responsible for its environmental impacts. Clinker is made by sintering a mixture composed mainly of limestone and clay (called “raw meal”) at temperatures up to 1450 °C. Both primary and secondary fuels are used to this end. After sintering, clinker nodules have a diameter between 5 mm and 25 mm.
;Clinker consists of various calcium silicates including alite (3CaO.SiO2 or “C3S”) and belite (2CaO.SiO2 or “C2S”). Tricalcium aluminate (3CaO.Al2O3 or “C3A”) and calcium aluminoferrite (4CaO.Al2O3.Fe2O3 or “C4AF”) are other common components, added to reduce the sintering temperature of the calcium silicates. For special cement types, such as low heat and sulfate resistant, it is necessary to limit the amount of tricalcium aluminate formed.;Naturally occurring calcareous deposits such as limestone, marl or chalk provide calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and quarries are often close to the cement plant. Clay, shale and sand are the preferred sources for silica. Iron ore and bauxite are the main sources of iron oxide and alumina. Raw materials are mixed at a certain proportion and are milled together in an operation called pre-homogenization, producing the “raw meal”. To ensure high cement quality, the chemistry of the raw materials and of the raw meal is very carefully monitored and controlled.;Portland cement clinker is made by heating the raw meal in a rotary kiln (calcination). As the kiln rotates, the material slides and tumbles down through progressively hotter zones towards the flame. The fuel is fired directly into the end of the kiln. The calcination reaction (CaCO3 → CaO + CO2) emits carbon dioxide into the air, and fuel combustion generates several air emissions. Different types of fuels can be used, including fossil fuels, biomass and wastes. The use of waste fuels in the cement kiln is called “coprocessing”.;Depending on the process configuration, the kiln can be preceded by preheating and/or precalcining steps. Preheating consists of a series of cyclones through which the raw meal is passed, coming in contact with swirling hot kiln exhaust gases moving in the opposite direction. The precalciner is a combustion chamber at the bottom of the preheater, at the entry of the kiln. ;After the kiln, clinker is cooled and stored in silos. Clinker production plants are usually integrated with cement plants.;Primary data were gathered from six cement manufacturers in Brazil, who informed the total values of inputs and outputs related to clinker production in 2016, considering all their clinker production sites. All types of flows were reported, namely: primary and secondary raw materials and fuels, auxiliary materials, electricity consumption, water consumption and air emissions (from emissions monitoring reports). It corresponds to 70% market share, considered a good representativeness level.;SOURCES:

The acitivty starts when scrap arrives at the recycling facility and ends with secondary steel (billets) produced.
The major feedstock for the EAF is ferrous scrap, which may comprise internal scrap from inside the steelworks, cut-offs from steel product manufacturers (e.g. the automotive industry), post-consumer scrap, and scrap recovered from other waste treatment processes (e.g. municipal solid waste incineration). The production of steel in the EAF process is a discontinuous process, which involves raw material handling and storage, furnace charging with/without scrap preheating, EAF scrap melting, steel and slag tapping, ladle furnace treatments for quality adjustment, slag handling and continuous casting. The actual melting is done by lowering graphite electrodes into the scrap until they strike an arc that melts the scrap.

This activity represents the production of stainless steel (Type 304, aka. 18/8; assumed composition 68.6% Fe, 9.3% Ni, 19.0% Cr and 0.08% C) in a two-stage process. Raw materials (charge chrome, pig iron, carbon steel scrap and ferronickel) are loaded into an electric arc furnace (EAF) and melted together. The composition of the charge corresponds to that of the desired steel product, besides the carbon content. The molten metal is then removed from the EAF and transferred to an argon-oxygen decarburisation (AOD) refining vessel, in which the amounts of impurities, principally carbon, are reduced to the desired levels. The purified molten metal is then continuously cast into stainless steel slabs (Norgate et al., 2004).

Modelling approach:
Data on the use of electricity, oxygen, argon and electrodes were taken from Norgate et al. (2004) and are specific to stainless steel production. The amounts of steel by-products (dusts, sludges and slags) that are produced are based on measured data from plants worldwide reported by worldsteel (2010). Also based on worldsteel (2010), the following internal recycling rates (i.e. returned as an input to the process after it has been produced) were assumed: EAF slag, 3%; secondary metallurgy slag, 14%; and dust, 10%.

Also based on worldsteel (2010), the following internal recycling rates (i.e. returned as an input to the process after it has been produced) were assumed: EAF slag, 3%; secondary metallurgy slag, 14%; and dust, 10%. All other data were taken from the IPPC Best Available Technology report from the European Commission (Remus et al., 2013) and are representative of typical low- and un-alloyed steel production in an electric arc furnace in Europe. Note that where only data ranges were provided, the geometric mean of reported values was used here.
